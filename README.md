## Why HYKU?

The goal of the HYKU is to create a pen tablet that is optimized for low latency. Most drawing tablets currently available offer polling rates below 200 Hz and have some level of hardware filtering that further decreases responsiveness, while the HYKU provides 600 Hz of raw sensor output.
